      <description>Convert array to bundles by Iterator module At last post Run first Action Flow Scenario I created HTTP request module to check data job status. Based on the scenario, today I would like to create next module to cancel running data jobs.
Because next module is also HTTP request, it is convenient to clone last module and modify something. I right click the last module, then select Clone menu, then new module is generated and connected with previous module.</description>

      <description>Action Flow as HTTP client From today I would like to introduce Action Flow, that is possible to automate scenario and integrate SaaS systems (also on-premise too).
You may know that 100 over SaaS systems are registered in Action Flow and easily build your own scenario. Great, but I sometimes felt that I could not find appropriate module from that. How do I fullfill my requirement ?
Actually Action Flow can be used HTTP client, so what I did by cURL at last post Operate Celonis from outside by REST API is also possible in Action Flow.</description>

      <description>Until last post, I have seen the flow of process discovery through Celonis Process Analytics (or Studio Analysis) and prerequisite ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Load) by Data Integration. I already worked in multiple static process mining projects and found that they are enough functions for static process mining. And other process mining solutions are provided these functions too.
By the way, referring to Process Mining Data Science in Action by Wil van der Aalst, Process Mining can also make it possible for further actions such as monitoring and predictive analysis.</description>

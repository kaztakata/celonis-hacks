      <description>Until last post, I have seen the flow of process discovery through Celonis Process Analytics (or Studio Analysis) and prerequisite ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Load) by Data Integration. I already worked in multiple static process mining projects and found that they are enough functions for static process mining. And other process mining solutions are provided these functions too.
By the way, referring to Process Mining Data Science in Action by Wil van der Aalst, Process Mining can also make it possible for further actions such as monitoring and predictive analysis.</description>

      <description>Until last post Validate Data Model by Studio Analysis, I completed creating ETL programs in Data Integration. But this is still test product because this programs are executed manually by operator. In this post, I would like to share the final piece of Data Integration, how to run ETL programs automatically after production release.
There are several ways to achieve automatic ETL, for example in my production system I am using scheduler in Machine Learning Workbench to trigger Jupyter Notebook, then operate Data Integration via Pycelonis (Python API for Celonis EMS).</description>

      <description>Recently I was thinking how to share my work with you not only blog post but experience by live environment. Today I would like to tell how to reproduce my Analysis to your environment by Content-CLI. Content-CLI is used to copy programs between Celonis environments via backup file. I created backup file and upload to public repository. So you can download it and reproduce my program in your environment.
First you need to open your training environment if you do not.</description>

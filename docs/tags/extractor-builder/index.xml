      <description>In the last post Configure Endpoint for Suitable Extraction, I configured Endpoint in Extractor Builder to suit my business requirements, and still there are points to extract change history of issues, and to extract data by Delta Load option. Today I would like to setup regarding change history.
At first how do I extract change history of Planio Issue ? Again I looked at Planio Documentation and found I can get single issue with journals (change history) by GET /issues/123.</description>

      <description>In the last post Connect to Source System via REST API, I shared how to set up Extractor Builder and extracted Issue from Planio. It was shortest path to be avaiable for extraction job, so it is not enough for production job. Today I would like to configure Endpoint in Extractor Builder to resolve problems I experienced.
First problem I faced is upper limit of extraction data. Some day I found that I could not get issue record until 25.</description>

      <description>At previous post Prepare Source System to Generate Event Log, I prepared Planio as source system for this blog, and entered few events (create Issue, update Issue Status) to it. Now it is time to extract event log from Planio. As other SaaS solution do, Planio also has REST API to extract data from outside. Currently Celonis EMS has ability to extract from arbitrary system that has REST API, Extractor Builder.</description>
